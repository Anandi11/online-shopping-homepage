# online-shopping-homepage

This is a small static demo online shopping portal that sells only chocolates.

## Requirements
- Thi app




Files added:

- `index.html` — main entry page with product grid and cart drawer
- `styles.css` — styles for layout, product cards, and cart drawer
- `script.js` — product data and cart logic (localStorage)

How to run

Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use your editor's "Open in Browser" feature). No server required for demo functionality.

Notes & next steps

- Images are simple SVG placeholders defined in the page for portability. Replace them with real product images in an `assets/` folder as needed.
- Next improvements: add search/filter, product detail pages, and a backend to process real orders.
